# Why?

If you work building software,
you must have come across technical documentation at some point in your career.
Either be it an API reference or internal manuals,
technical documentation 
**is vital for the development process**.
Everyone expects it, 
but without it,
knowledge of the application becomes siloed 
within individuals which lead to inefficiencies 
in the whole development process.

To ensure long-term sustainability of your software projects,
having a clear and detailed record
of the `why`, `how` and `what`
helps maintain consistency 
and increases the quality of your work!

Whether it is meant as an internal reference 
or you're creating documentation for public-facing clients
that are using your project, 
having documentation benefits both the developers and users alike.


# What?

[`Nextra`](https://nextra.site/) is a framework
that makes it easy for you to create a documentation static website
fully optimized and powered by [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/).

It simpifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation
by offering a myriad of features, such as:
- themable design system.
- markdown support.
- full-text search out-of-the-box.
- automatic [`a11y`](https://www.a11yproject.com/).
- filesystem-based organization.

Its integration with `Next.js` means that it's fully customizable,
making it ideal for your team to quickly generate a website
that is useful for both internal and external documentation.


# Who?

This walkthrough is meant for beginners of the framework
but also seasoned software developers 
that want to create internal and external documentation for their teams.

This will **not be an introduction to technical writing**,
it will solely focus on the `Nextra` framework.
