# Why?

If you work building software,
you must have come across technical documentation at some point in your career.
Either be it an API reference or internal manuals,
technical documentation 
**is vital for the development process**.
Everyone expects it, 
but without it,
knowledge of the application becomes siloed 
within individuals which lead to inefficiencies 
in the whole development process.

To ensure long-term sustainability of your software projects,
having a clear and detailed record
of the `why`, `how` and `what`
helps maintain consistency 
and increases the quality of your work!

Whether it is meant as an internal reference 
or you're creating documentation for public-facing clients
that are using your project, 
having documentation benefits both the developers and users alike.


# What?

[`Nextra`](https://nextra.site/) is a framework
that makes it easy for you to create a documentation static website
fully optimized and powered by [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/).

It simpifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation
by offering a myriad of features, such as:
- themable design system.
- markdown support.
- full-text search out-of-the-box.
- automatic [`a11y`](https://www.a11yproject.com/).
- filesystem-based organization.

Its integration with `Next.js` means that it's fully customizable,
making it ideal for your team to quickly generate a website
that is useful for both internal and external documentation.


# Who?

This walkthrough is meant for beginners of the framework
but also seasoned software developers 
that want to create internal and external documentation for their teams.

This will **not be an introduction to technical writing**,
it will solely focus on the `Nextra` framework.
We recommend visiting https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview
if you are interested in learning more about technical writing.

If you find it useful, give the repo a star! ‚≠êÔ∏è

If you get stuck, have questions/suggestions
or just want to discuss this further,
[do open an issue](https://github.com/dwyl/nextra-demo/issues)!


# How?

Are we ready to start? Let's go!

> [!TIP]
>
> Some of the information found in this document
> can also be found in the [`Nextra`'s offical docs](https://nextra.site/docs).
> We recommend going through their documentation 
> (it's not long) to better have a feeling over the framework.

When using `Nextra`, 
you first have to make a choice:
- you either use a *default theme*.
- you customize your own.

The vast majority of people will go for the former.
However, if you are looking to have a more customized look,
you may have to create your own theme.
[It's easier to start with a custom theme than using a default one and change it afterwards](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/issues/2926).

In our case, 
we'll start with the default theme and change it if needed.


## 0. Start a new project

Let's create our project.
We first need to install some dependencies.
We're going to use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
throughout the project to manage dependencies.

```sh
pnpm add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

This will create a `package.json` file
and install the dependencies under `node_modules`.

Now, let's add some scripts to `package.json` 
to be able to run our application.
Add the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

Your `package.json` will look something like this.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.2.4",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "nextra": "^2.13.4",
    "nextra-theme-docs": "^2.13.4"
  }
}
```

Next, we need to add a `Nextra` config file.
Because we're starting a project from scratch,
it has no idea it's a `Next.js` project.
Create a file called `next.config.js` and add the following.

```js
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx',
  defaultShowCopyCode: true
})
 
module.exports = withNextra()
```

Here we add global configurations to our project.
For example, we've added `defaultShowCopyCode: true`,
which will make it so code snippets
will have a copy button.

Lastly, we need to create
a corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project‚Äôs root directory.
It will be used to configure our `Nextra`'s site theme.
We'll just add the basic ones.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can check the full theme configurations
> [in their documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

Now we're ready to bounce!
Because `Nextra` is a **file-based system framework**
(much like `Next.js`),
you will have to create all the documentation
under the `pages` folder.
Let's start create our first one under `pages/index.mdx`!

```mdx
# Welcome to our docs!
 
Hello, world!
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> [`mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) files are markdown files
> that allow you to write `JSX` content.
> You can import components and embed them within your markdown files.

Let's see our handiwork.
Run `pnpm run dev` 
and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
You should see your page!

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/532ac0ca-312b-44cf-ac9a-a8801888ae55"/>
</p>

Congratulations!
You've just set up your documentation website!
Give yourself a pat on the back. üëè


## 1. Organizing your content

Now let's write some content!
We are going to organize our documentation
so it's easier to navigate.

In `Nextra`, 
the site and page structure can be configured via
[`_meta.json`](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/organize-files) files.
These files will affect the layout of the theme,
especially the sidebar/navigation bar.

For example, the title and order of a page shown in the sidebar
should be configured in the `_meta.json` file as key-value pairs.
Create the following structure in your project.

```
pages
|_ api_reference
    |_ _meta.json
    |_ about.mdx
|_ _meta.json
|_ about.mdx
|_ contact.mdx
|_ index.mdx
```

Define the pages in the top-level `_meta.json`, like so.

```json
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "api_reference": "API Reference",
  "about": "About Us"
}
```

And in the nested `_meta.json` file,
inside `api_reference`.

```json
{
  "about": "about"
}
```

As you can see, you can group pages together in directories
**to create _an hierarchy_** of pages, 
thus organizing them neatly.

If you want a folder to have their own page,
you can simply add a `.mdx` file
a level above, with the name of the folder.
Let's say we want `api_reference` to have an introductory page
when we click on it on the sidebar.
Simply create the file above the folder's level!

```
pages
|_ api_reference
    |_ _meta.json
    |_ about.mdx
|_ _meta.json
|_ about.mdx
|_ contact.mdx
|_ api_reference.mdx   // added this
|_ index.mdx
```

Alternatively, you can create an `index.mdx` file inside `api_reference`
to achieve a similar effect.


Now fill each `.mdx` with any content you want.
Run `pnpm run dev` and see your pages organized!

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/a1122331-3416-4232-b412-272cae84d9d6"/>
</p>


### 1.1 External  links and hidden routes

You can further customize the `_meta.json` 
to show external links
and hide some routes.

In the top-level `_meta.json`,
change it to the following.

```json
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "api_reference": "API Reference",
  "about": "About Us",
  "github_link": {
    "title": "Github",
    "href": "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
    "newWindow": true
  }
}
```

This will add a new link to the sidebar that,
once clicked,
will redirect the person to the `Github` page.

You can also hide it. 
Simply add the `display` property and set it to `hidden`,
just like in `CSS`!

```json
{
  "index": "My Homepage",
  "contact": "Contact Us",
  "api_reference": "API Reference",
  "about": "About Us",
  "github_link": {
    "title": "Github",
    "href": "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
    "newWindow": true,
    "display": "hidden"
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Adding items to the navbar

The navbar is a great way to further organize your content.
You can show special pages on the navigation bar 
instead of the sidebar.
To do this, you need to use the `"type": "page"` property
in the `_meta.json` file at top level.

Let's add the `API Reference` to the navbar.
To do this, edit the top-level `_meta.json` to look like so:

```json
{
  "index": {
    "title": "Homepage",
    "type": "page",
    "display": "hidden"
  },
  "api_reference": {
    "title": "API Reference",
    "type": "page"
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "About Us",
    "type": "page"
  },
  "contact": {
    "title": "Contact Us",
    "type": "page"
  },
  "github_link": {
    "title": "Github",
    "href": "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
    "newWindow": true,
    "display": "hidden"
  }
}
```

This will make every single top-level file
a page on the navbar.
We've hidden the `index.mdx`,
because it's rendered by default when we enter the site
and we can return to it if we click on the website's logo.
Inside `api_reference`,
create a new file called `users.mdx` 
and write whatever you want in it.
Let's change the `_meta.json` file inside this directory
to the following.

```json
{
  "about": "about",
  "---": {
    "type": "separator"
  },
  "users": "users"
}
```

Notice that we've added `"---"`. 
This will add a separator between the two sidebar items.

If you run `pnpm run dev`, 
you will see that your site is organized differently.
The top-level pages are in the navbar,
and you can check the sidebar inside the `api_reference` folder contents.

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/ce73b6d9-6890-4ee4-9635-354f88cbe887"/>
</p>

Awesome! üéâ

There are the basics on how to organize your content
inside your website!


## 2. Adding authentication

Now that our website is in working order,
let's work in adding authentication to it!
This is important because
you may want to use this website
*for internal purposes*,
meaning that **it can't be public-facing**.

To address this issue,
we are going to make the users have to sign in 
through a given provider 
to be able to visit private pages
that we will define ourselves.

Let's rock! üé∏

We are going to be using 
[`Auth.js`](https://authjs.dev/) to streamline our authentication process.
This framework was previously working solely on `Next.js` projects,
but this new `v5` release extends their compatibility to other frameworks.

Let's add it to our project!

> [!NOTE]
>
> At the time of writing, 
> only the `beta` version of `auth.js` is working.
> We'll update this doc when a full stable release is announced.

```sh
pnpm add next-auth@beta
```

Great!
Now let's create our secret. 
We are going to be using this secret as an [environment variable](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables),
which is used by the library to encrypt token and e-mail verification hashes.
Simply run:

```sh
npx auth secret
```

Your terminal will show this:

```
Need to install the following packages:
auth@1.0.2
Ok to proceed? (y) y

Secret generated. Copy it to your .env/.env.local file (depending on your framework):

AUTH_SECRET=<your_secret>
```

Copy the secret and create a file called `.env.local`.

```sh
AUTH_SECRET=secret
```

Great!
Now let's create the configuration files needed for `Auth.js` to work!
Start by creating a file called `auth.ts` at the root.

```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [],
});
```

Then, create the following folders from the root of the project - 
`/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/`.
`Nextra` only works in the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages).
Authentication with `Auth.js` needs the 
[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) to work.
For this, we need to create the folder hierarchy we've just mentioned.

After creating the folders,
create a file called `route.ts` inside `[...nextauth].

```ts
import { handlers } from "@/auth" // Referring to the auth.ts we just created
export const { GET, POST } = handlers
```

And add a file called `middleware.ts` at the root of the project.
This is to keep the session alive, 
this will update the session expiry every time its called.

```ts
export { auth as middleware } from "@/auth"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your imports may be complaining about not being able to find the `@auth` module.
> To fix this, create a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of the project
> with the following code.
> 
> ```json
> {
>  "compilerOptions": {
>    "target": "es5",
>    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
>    "allowJs": true,
>    "skipLibCheck": true,
>    "strict": true,
>    "noEmit": true,
>    "esModuleInterop": true,
>    "module": "esnext",
>    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
>    "resolveJsonModule": true,
>    "isolatedModules": true,
>    "jsx": "preserve",
>    "incremental": true,
>    "plugins": [
>      {
>        "name": "next"
>      }
>    ],
>    "paths": {
>      "@/*": ["./*"]
>    }
>  },
>  "include": [
>    "next-env.d.ts",
>    "**/*.ts",
>    "**/*.tsx",
>    ".next/types/**/*.ts",
>    "app/lib/placeholder-data.js",
>    "scripts/seed.js"
>  ],
>  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
> }

And that's it!
We're all ready to go!


### 2.1 Adding Github provider

You can now decide how you are going to authenticate the users into your application.
You can either:
- choose an [`OAuth`](https://oauth.net/2/), 
a delegated authentication where you delegate through a third party.
- or you can set up your own [identity provider](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/)
and take care of it yourself.

We're going to choose the former, because it's easier.
[`Auth.js` docs](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication) explain it succinctly.

> OAuth services spend significant amounts of money, time, and engineering effort to build abuse detection (bot-protection, rate-limiting), 
> password management (password reset, credential stuffing, rotation),
> data security (encryption/salting, strength validation), and much more. 
> It is likely that your application would benefit from leveraging these battle-tested solutions rather than try to rebuild them from scratch.

Let's authenticate our users through a GitHub provider!

Let's add it to our `providers` array inside `auth.ts`

```ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [GitHub],
});

```

Next, create an **`OAuth` app** inside our GitHub account.
Navigate to `https://github.com/settings/developers`
and click on `OAuth Apps`
and click on `New OAuth App`.

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/bcf20102-d76f-474e-a144-f5623f1e3289"/>
</p>

Fill out the information.
The default callback URL will be of the form of 
`[origin]/api/auth/callback/[provider]`.
While developing, you may use `localhost` as the `origin`.
However, you'll have to chance this to your product's domain in production.

```sh
// Local
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
 
// Prod
https://app.company.com/api/auth/callback/github
```

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/b57b4adf-a1bb-4ecc-bdd5-00725e84f99f"/>
</p>

After completing the form,
you will be redirected to the page of your newly created `OAuth` app.
Click on `Generate a new client secret`.

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/dab08580-337a-4ca7-b8d5-9f0c73b91862"/>
</p>

You will be shown the secret of the new app.
Do not close the page, you will need to copy this `secret` and the shown `client ID.`

<p align="center">
  <img width='800' src="https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs/assets/17494745/1b690614-cba3-4187-8448-72dc9e9fd62c"/>
</p>

In your `.env.local` file,
add these two copied strings, like so.

```sh
AUTH_SECRET=

AUTH_GITHUB_ID=
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=
```

And that's all the configuration we need!
Now it's time to authenticate people into our app!


### 2.2 Letting people `Sign In` and `Sign Out`

With all the configuration out of the way,
it's time to a way for people to **sign in** and **sign out** of our Nextra website.

Before continuing, 
let's change our site's structure a little bit.
Make it like so.

```
pages
|_ reference_api          // yes, change from 'api_reference' to 'reference_api'
    |_ mega_private       // add this new folder
      |_ _meta.json
      |_ hello.mdx
    |_ _meta.json
    |_ about.mdx
    |_ mega_private.mdx  // This is the index page of `mega_private` that will show on the sidebar. Write whatever.
    |_ users.mdx
|_ _meta.json
|_ about.mdx
|_ api_reference.mdx
|_ contact.mdx
|_ index.mdx
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Change the root `_meta.json` file pertaining to `"api_reference"`
> to `"reference_api"`, and the folder as well.
>
> This is important because we are going to have a middleware
> that is going to match routes to perform authorization checks.
> `Next.js` projects usually have APIs under `/api`,
> which means the middleware was not going to perform verifications on anything
> under `api`.

Create a new folder `mega_private` inside `api_reference`.
We'll use this later.
You can write whatever you want in it.
Keep the `_meta.json` inside `mega_private` simple, like so.

```json
{
    "hello": "Hello page"    
}
```

Great!

`next-auth` provides a set of built-in pages
for people to go through their authentication journey
(sign in, sign up, sign out, error, etc...).
[Although you can customize your own pages](https://authjs.dev/guides/pages/signin),
we are going to leverage these built-in pages
to keep the tutorial simple.

To allow people to sign in,
let's create a component to be shown in `pages/index.mdx`,
the root page of the site.

For this, create a folder called `components` on the root of the project.
Inside of `components`, create `LoginOrUserInfo`,
and inside this one create a file called `index.ts` (`components/LoginOrUserInfo/index.tsx`).

```ts
import { signOut, signIn } from "next-auth/react";
import { DefaultSession } from "next-auth";

export function LoginOrUserInfo({ session } : Readonly<{session: DefaultSession}>) {
  if (session?.user) {
    return (
      <div>
        <span>
          Welcome <b>{session.user.name}</b>
        </span>{" "}
        <br />
        <button onClick={() => signOut()}>SIGN OUT</button>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return <button onClick={() => signIn()}>SIGN IN</button>;
  }
}
```

We are exporting a function `LoginOrUserInfo` 
that receives `Session` object (from `next-auth`).
Inside this component, what we do is really simple:
show his name and a `SignOut` button if they are logged in;
otherwise, show a button to `SignIn`.

We are leveraging both `signIn` and `signOut` functions from `next-auth`.

> [!WARNING]
>
> By creating these nested folders,
> we have to update the `tsconfig.json` file to encompass
> files that are nested on more than two levels.
>
> ```json
> "include": [
>   "next-env.d.ts",
>   "*/**/*.ts",       // add this line
>   "**/*.ts",
>   "**/*.tsx",
>   ".next/types/**/*.ts",
>   "app/lib/placeholder-data.js",
>   "scripts/seed.js"
> ],
> ```

Now let's use our newly created component.
Go to `pages/index.mdx` and add the following code to the top.

```mdx
import { auth } from "@/auth.ts"
import { useData } from 'nextra/data'
import Link from 'next/link'
import { signOut } from "next-auth/react"
import { LoginOrUserInfo } from "@/components/LoginOrUserInfo"

export async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  const session = await auth(ctx)

return {
      props: {
        // We add an `ssg` field to the page props,
        // which will be provided to the Nextra `useData` hook.
        ssg: {
          session
        }
      }
    }
}

export const Info = () => {
  // Get the data from SSG, and render it as a component.
  const { session } = useData()
  return <LoginOrUserInfo session={session}/>
```

We are using [`getServerSideProps` ](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
to fetch the session from the `auth` function from `next-auth`.
For more information about this inside `Nextra`,
visit https://nextra.site/docs/guide/ssg.

We need to return the session inside an object `props`
and adding a named property called `ssg`
with the data we want to send over the components we want to display.
`Nextra` retrieves this data using the `useData()` hook.

In the `Info` component, we fetch the `session` object
from the `auth` and pass it to the component 
we've created `<LoginOrUserInfo>`.

All that's left is using this component in our `.mdx` file.
Simply add `<Info/>` (the component we've created inside `.mdx`)
wherever you want in the page1

If you run the application, you should be able to sign in and sign out!

We now have access to [`JWT` tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction) in our application,
where `GitHub`'s `OAuth` provider is providing them for us.

Now let's start using it to start protecting routes!


## 3. Protecting routes

We now have a basic authentication flow in our site,
with `GitHub` providing and managing the tokens for our application for us.
It's in our interest to restrict certain routes to specific users
with specific roles if we ever want to make our awesome documentation site
*available to different clients*.


### 3.1 A word about `middleware.ts`

Normally, when developing applications that follow the normal
`Frontend -> Backend -> Database` convention,
you usually want to have security measures
**as close to the data as possible**.

[With `React Server Components` being introduced in `Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components),
the line between server and client gets blurred.
Data handling is paramount in understanding where information is processed
and subsequently made available.
So we always have to be careful to know
how authentication and how protecting routes is implemented
and *where* it is processed,
so it's not subject to malicious actors.


> [!NOTE]
>
> To learn more about Data Access Layers,
> please visit https://x.com/delba_oliveira/status/1800921612105011284
> and https://nextjs.org/blog/security-nextjs-server-components-actions.
> These links provide great insights on how to implement a Data Access Layer
> to better encapsulate your data and minimize security pitfalls.

For this purpose,
because `Nextra` statically generates pages,
we are going to be using [**`middleware`**](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware)
to protect the routes.
[`next-auth`](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/session-management/protecting?framework=express#api-routes)
warns people to
**on middleware exclusively for authorization and to always ensure that the session is verified as close to your data fetching as possible.**
While that is true
(and a reiteration of what was aforementioned),
protecting the routes in our application
through `middleware`
is optimistically secure enough
(as it runs on the server-side),
as it runs on every request,
including prefetched routes.
Additionally, [`Next.js` recommends doing so](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication#protecting-routes-with-middleware).

> "This is important for keeping areas like the user dashboard protected while having other pages like marketing pages be public.
> It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access.


### 3.2 Adding `middleware.ts` logic

As per `Next.js`'s convention,
to add this middleware,
we need to create a `middleware.ts` file at the root of the project.

Create it and add the following code to it:

```ts
// middleware.ts

"server only";

import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

// !!!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE VARIABLE !!!!
const privateRoutesMap: any = {};

export default auth(async (req, ctx) => {
  const currentPath = req.nextUrl.pathname;
  const isProtectedRoute = currentPath in privateRoutesMap

  if(isProtectedRoute) {
    // Check for valid session
    const session = req.auth

    // Redirect unauthed users
    if(!session?.user || !session.user.role) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/api/auth/signin', req.nextUrl))
    }

    // Redirect users that don't have the necessary roles
    const neededRolesForPath = privateRoutesMap[currentPath]
    if(!(session.user.role && neededRolesForPath.includes(session.user.role))) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/api/auth/signin', req.nextUrl))
    }
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - api (API routes)
     * - _next/static (static files)
     * - _next/image (image optimization files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     */
    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
  ],
}

```

Let's break down what we just wrote:

- **`privateRoutesMap`** is an object/map that will have the **path** as `key`
and the **array of roles needed to access the path** as `value`.
This variable will be changed on build-time,
so do not change its name!
- we export **`auth`** as default from `middleware.ts`.
This function is called before every route server-side.
Inside it, we check the path and the session cookie.
With these, we can know *if the route is protected* or not.
If it is, we check if the person can access it with the given role.
If any of these conditions fail,
the person is redirected to the Sign In page.
- we also export a **`config`** object,
with a `matcher` property.
We use [`RegEx`](https://regexr.com/) to configure which paths we want the middleware to run on.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Your `Typescript` compiler may be complaining
> because `role` is not a property inside `user`.
> Don't worry, we'll fix this now.


### 3.3 Configuring `auth.ts`

`middleware.ts` assumes the `JWT` token to have a role
in order to do role-based authorization.
For it to have access to it
(and throughout the whole application),
we ought to head over to `auth.ts`
and do additional configuration.

Open `auth.ts` and change it the following.

```ts
// auth.ts

export const { handlers, signIn, signOut, auth } = NextAuth({
  providers: [
    GitHub({
      profile(profile) {
        // GitHub's OAuth apps don't allow you to define roles.
        // So `profile` here doesn't have a `role` property.
        // But on other providers, you'd add the role here through it.
        return {
          id: profile.id.toString(),
          name: profile.name ?? profile.login,
          email: profile.email,
          image: profile.avatar_url,
          role: "user",
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    jwt({ token, user, account, profile }) {
      // Normally, it would be like this
      // if(user) return {...token, role: token.role}
      // return token

      // But because Github's provider is not passing the role
      // (it should, according to https://authjs.dev/guides/role-based-access-control#with-jwt -
      // maybe it's because v5 is still in beta), we're just gonna append it every time
      return {...token, role: "user"}
    },
    session({ session, token }) {
      session.user.role = token.role;
      return session;
    },
  },
});
```

As usual, let's break it down!

- the `GitHub` provider accepts a **`profile()`** callback.
In this callback, we receive a `Profile` returned by the `OAuth` provider
(in our case, it's `GitHub`).
We can return a subset using the profile's information
to **define user's information in our application**.
By default, it returns the
`id`, `email`, `name`, `image`,
but we can add more.
That's what we did, by adding the **`role`** property.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're using a custom provider,
> it is your responsibility to return the role so you can capture it in
> your `Next.js`/`Nextra` application.

- we defined **`callbacks`** to add the role to our `JWT` tokens
and `session` cookies.
In order, the `jwt` callback receives the user information we've defined earlier.
We append the `role` to the token.
Afterwards, the `session` callback is invoked,
where we use the `role` property we've just appended to the `token`
and add it to the `session` cookie.

But that's not all!
Because we are effectively
*extending* the properties of the `User`,
we can [**augment it through types**](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation),
so `Typescript` doesn't complain about `role`
being an `undefined` property.

In the same `auth.ts` file,
add the following code at the top.

```ts
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github";
import NextAuth, { type DefaultSession } from "next-auth";
// we don't use these but we need to import something so we can override the interface
import {  DefaultJWT } from "next-auth/jwt";
import { AdapterSession } from 'next-auth/adapters';

// We need to add the role to the JWT inside `NextAuth` below, so the `middleware.ts` can have access to it.
// The problem is that it wasn't added this `role` custom field, even if we defined it in `auth.ts`.
// Apparently, the problem is with the types of `next-auth`, which we need to redefine.
// See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74425533/property-role-does-not-exist-on-type-user-adapteruser-in-nextauth
// and see https://authjs.dev/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation.

declare module "next-auth" {
  interface Session extends DefaultSession {
    /**
     * By default, TypeScript merges new interface properties and overwrites existing ones.
     * In this case, the default session user properties will be overwritten,
     * with the new ones defined above. To keep the default session user properties,
     * we need to add them back into the newly declared interface.
     */
    user: DefaultSession["user"] & {
      role?: string;
    };
  }

  interface User {
    // Additional properties here:
    role?: string;
  }
}

declare module "next-auth/adapters" {
  interface AdapterUser {
    // Additional properties here:
    role?: string;
  }
}

declare module "next-auth/jwt" {
  interface JWT {
    role?: string;
  }
}
```

And that's it! üéâ
Give yourself a pat on the back!

Now that we have the authentication and authorization set up,
it's time to *finally use it*.


## 4. Generating private routes

As you may have noticed by now,
`Nextra` statically generates the page for you
following the structure and the `_meta.json` files
that you define in your project.
These changes are then reflected in your navbar and sidebar.

However, there is *no way for us to define private routes*
and **use them at build-time**,
like you do when generating the pages with `Nextra`.
Unfortunately, `Nextra` doesn't have this feature in place,
and authentication is not something they had in mind to implement
for a framework that was primarily meant for public-facing documentation.

*However*, it is possible to do this,
considering what was discussed in
[3.1 A word about `middleware.ts`](#31-a-word-about-middlewarets),
_as long as we have access to the private routes at **build-time**_.

To accomplish this, we're using [`ts-morph`](https://ts-morph.com/),
a package that will allow us to manipulate Typescript source files.
We will create a script with `ts-morph` that manipulates the `const privateRoutesMap` inside `middleware.ts`.
This script will populate the `const` with all the private routes
and the needed roles to access them.

Let's crack on!


### 4.1 Installing `ts-morph` and setup

Install `ts-morph`, [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) (to run the script we're implementing)
and [`fast-glob`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-glob)
(to traverse the file system).

```sh
pnpm add ts-morph ts-node fast-glob
```

After installing these dependencies,
we will have to adjust our `tsconfig.json` file
so we can run our script independently.
Below the `exclude` property, in the last line,
add the following piece of code.

```json
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],

  // These are only used by `ts-node` to run the script that generates the private routes.
  // These options are overrides used only by ts-node, same as the --compilerOptions flag and the TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS environment variable
  "ts-node": {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "commonjs"
    }
  },
```

Great!
Let's start implementing our script now.


### 4.2 Creating `generatePrivateRoutes.ts`

In the root of the project,
create a file called `generatePrivateRoutes.ts`.
Add the following code.

```ts
import { Project } from "ts-morph";
import path from "path";
import fs from "fs";
import { globSync } from "fast-glob";

// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - -
// `middleware.ts` is changed by executing the code below.

export function changeMiddleware() {
  const CONST_VARIABLE_NAME = "privateRoutesMap"; // Name of the constant inside `middleware.ts` to be manipulated
  const DIRECTORY = "pages"; // Directory to look for the routes (should be `pages`, according to Nextra's file system)
  
  // Get private routes
  const pagesDir = path.join(__dirname, DIRECTORY);
  const privateRoutes = getPrivateRoutes(pagesDir);
  
  // Initialize the project and source file
  const project = new Project();
  const sourceFile = project.addSourceFileAtPath(path.resolve(__dirname, "middleware.ts"));
  
  // Find the variable to replace and change it's declaration
  const variable = sourceFile.getVariableDeclaration(CONST_VARIABLE_NAME);
  if (variable) {
    variable.setInitializer(JSON.stringify(privateRoutes));
    sourceFile.saveSync();
  } else {
    console.error("Variable not found in `middleware.ts`. File wasn't changed.");
  }  
}

export default {
  changeMiddleware: () => changeMiddleware()
}
```

The code is fairly simple.
We get the private routes by calling a function called `getPrivateRoutes()`
(which we will implement shortly).
Then, we find the `middleware.ts` file
and find the variable we want to change.
If we do find it, we change its initialization
to the private routes map we retrieved earlier.
Otherwise, we log an error.

Now, it's time to add the function
that will *retrieve the private routes*!


### 4.3 Implementing private route retrieval function

Our function `getPrivateRoutes` will need to recursively iterate
over a given folder directory and find a way to know which routes are private.
As of now, there's no way of doing so.

That's why we're going
**to define a new property inside `_meta.json` files**.


#### 4.3.1 Defining `_meta.json` files with `private` properties

We need to tell our function which pages/routes are private.
To do this, we are going to use the `_meta.json` files
that come with `Nextra`.

To achieve this,
we are going to allow people to declare a route as private
by adding a **`private`** property to a route defined in the respective `_meta.json`.

```json
// pages/_meta.json
{
  "index": {
    "title": "Homepage",
    "type": "page",
    "display": "hidden"
  },
  "reference_api": {
    "title": "API Reference",
    "type": "page",
    "private": {                // We add this property to make `reference_api` private
      "private": true,
      "roles": ["user"]
    }
  },
  "about": {
    "title": "About Us",
    "type": "page"
  },
  "contact": {
    "title": "Contact Us",
    "type": "page"
  },
  "github_link": {
    "title": "Github",
    "href": "https://github.com/shuding/nextra",
    "newWindow": true,
    "display": "hidden"
  }
}
```

As you can see, we've added a property called **`private`**
to the `reference_api` route,
where we define if it's private or not by boolean in the `private` property
and where we define the roles that can access it
in the `roles` property.

Alternatively, people can define private routes by simply
passing `"private": true`, instead of passing an object.
In these cases, the `roles` empty will default to an empty array,

```json
  "reference_api": {
    "title": "API Reference",
    "type": "page",
    "private": true             // Simpler version
  },
```

We'll take into account both of these scenarios.


#### 4.3.2 Implementing the function

Okay, now let's start coding our function!
Inside `generatePrivateRoutes.ts`,
add this function above the `ts-morph` code
we've written earlier.

```ts
// Types for the `_meta.json` structure
type PrivateInfo = {
  private: boolean;
  roles?: string[];
};

type MetaJson = {
  [key: string]: string | any | PrivateInfo;
};

type PrivateRoutes = {
  [key: string]: string[];
};

/**
 * This function looks at the file system under a path and goes through each `_meta.json` looking for private routes recursively.
 * It is expecting the `_meta.json` values of keys to have a property called "private" to consider the route as private for specific roles.
 * If a parent is private, all the children are private as well. The children inherit the roles of their direct parent.
 * @param pagesDir path to recursively look for.
 * @returns map of private routes as key and array of roles that are permitted to access the route.
 */
function getPrivateRoutes(pagesDir: string): PrivateRoutes {
  let privateRoutes: PrivateRoutes = {};

  // Find all _meta.json files recursively
  const metaFiles = globSync(path.join(pagesDir, "**/_meta.json"));

  // Variable to keep track if parent is private on nested routes and its role
  const rootPrivateSettings: { [key: string]: { private: boolean; roles: string[] } } = {};

  // Iterate over the found meta files
  for (const file of metaFiles) {
    // Get the path of file and read it
    const dir = path.dirname(file);
    const metaJson: MetaJson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, "utf-8"));

    // Iterate over the key/value pairs of the "_meta.json" file
    for (const [key, meta] of Object.entries(metaJson)) {
      const route = path.join(dir, key).replace(pagesDir, "").replace(/\\/g, "/");

      // Check if the current meta has a "private" property
      if (meta.private !== undefined) {
        if (typeof meta.private === "boolean") {
          if (meta.private) {
            privateRoutes[route] = [];
            rootPrivateSettings[dir] = { private: true, roles: [] };
          }
        }
        // If the "private" property is an object with possible roles
        else if (meta.private.private === true) {
          const roles = meta.private.roles ? meta.private.roles : [];
          privateRoutes[route] = roles;
          rootPrivateSettings[dir] = { private: true, roles: roles };
        }
      } else {
        // Check if the parent folder is private and inherit roles
        const parentDir = path.resolve(dir, "..");
        if (rootPrivateSettings[parentDir] && rootPrivateSettings[parentDir].private) {
          const parentRoles = rootPrivateSettings[parentDir].roles;
          privateRoutes[route] = parentRoles;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Now let's just do a second pass to clean-up possible unwanted/invalid routes
  for (const route of Object.keys(privateRoutes)) {
    const fullPath = path.join(pagesDir, route);
    const lastSegment = route.split("/").pop();

    // Remove separators or any route that doesn't correspond to an existing file/directory
    if (lastSegment === "---") {
      delete privateRoutes[route];
      continue;
    }

    // Check for the existence of .mdx file
    const mdxPath = `${fullPath}.mdx`;
    if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath) && !fs.existsSync(mdxPath)) {
      delete privateRoutes[route];
    }
  }

  return privateRoutes;
}
```

Whoa, that's a lot!
The code is fairly documented so you can follow along easier.
But the gist of it is:
- we use `fast-glob` to find all the `_meta.json` files recursively.
- we iterate over the `_meta.json` files.
  - in each `_meta.json`, we look over the key-value pairs to construct the route.
  - in each key-value, we check for the `private` property and resolve its boolean.
  - while iterating, we keep track of the routes and check if the parent is also private. If the parent is private, the child must be private too. It also inherits the direct parent's roles.
- after iteration, we do a second pass to clean-up possible invalid routes.
- we return a map of `private route` as **key** and `roles array` as **value**.

And that's it!


### 4.4 Running the script before building

Now that we have our handy-dandy script ready,
we need to make sure it always gets executed before running our application,
whether it is being built for production
or compiling to be running on `localhost`.

To do this, we only need to change our `package.json` file.
Head over there and change the scripts, like so:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "private-route-gen": "ts-node -e \"import gen from './src/generatePrivateRoutes'; gen.changeMiddleware()\"",
    "dev": "npm run private-route-gen && next",
    "prebuild": "npm run private-route-gen",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
```

We've created a `private-route-gen`
that uses `ts-node` to run our script.
This newly added script is executed
when running `pnpm run dev` (running the app locally)
and `pnpm run build`.
[We've added it to the `prebuild` script](https://kontent.ai/blog/how-to-run-scripts-before-every-build-on-next-js/)
so it executes before production builds.

And that's it!
Now every time you run your application,
we are sure that the private routes are correctly materialized!

Hurray! üéâ


> [!NOTE]
>
> You may get an error when building the project saying:
>
> ```

> ```
>
> This is expected, since `Nextra` doesn't know what the `private` property is.
> This doesn't affect the performance of the application,

## 5. Moving source files to `src` folder

Before proceeding, let's do some cleaning up üßπ.
Right now, we have some source files
(like `auth.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `generatePrivateRoutes.ts`)
mixed with several configuration files at root level.

Luckily for us, `Next.js` supports adding a `src` folder
so we can keep the root directory focused on configuration files
and the `src` folder to source files.

Let's move our source code to a `src` folder!
Start by creating it at root level.
Then, move the following items into it:
- the `app` folder.
- the `components` folder.
- the `pages` folder.
- `auth.ts`, `middleware.ts` and `generatePrivateRoutes.ts` files.

Now we have to change some imports.
Check the following changes in each file so everything works again!

```ts
// src/pages/index.mdx
import { auth } from "@/src/auth.ts"    // changed from `@/auth.ts`
import { useData } from 'nextra/data'
import Link from 'next/link'
import { signOut } from "next-auth/react"
import LoginOrUserInfo from "@/src/components/LoginOrUserInfo" // changed from `@/components/LoginOrUserInfo`
```

```ts
// src/middleware.ts
"server only";

import { auth } from "@/src/auth";    // changed from `@/auth.ts`
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
```

```ts
// tests/unit/LoginOrUserInfo.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import LoginOrUserInfo from "@/src/components/LoginOrUserInfo";   // changed from `@/components/LoginOrUserInfo`
import { DefaultSession } from "next-auth";
import { signOut, signIn } from "next-auth/react";
```

```json
// package.json
"private-route-gen": "ts-node src/generatePrivateRoutes.ts",
```

And you're sorted!
We now have all our source files inside `src`,
the tests inside `tests`,
and all the configuration files at root level.






# Change theme

- custom theme is the only option
- although yuyou can change some aspects of the sidebar (https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration#customize-sidebar-content), you can't do it on the navbar (https://github.com/shuding/nextra/discussions/2799). Either way, the way Nextra does it doesn't allow us to have access to the authorization and change the display accordingly. We need to go deeper.
