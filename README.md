# Why?

If you work building software,
you must have come across technical documentation at some point in your career.
Either be it an API reference or internal manuals,
technical documentation 
**is vital for the development process**.
Everyone expects it, 
but without it,
knowledge of the application becomes siloed 
within individuals which lead to inefficiencies 
in the whole development process.

To ensure long-term sustainability of your software projects,
having a clear and detailed record
of the `why`, `how` and `what`
helps maintain consistency 
and increases the quality of your work!

Whether it is meant as an internal reference 
or you're creating documentation for public-facing clients
that are using your project, 
having documentation benefits both the developers and users alike.


# What?

[`Nextra`](https://nextra.site/) is a framework
that makes it easy for you to create a documentation static website
fully optimized and powered by [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/).

It simpifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation
by offering a myriad of features, such as:
- themable design system.
- markdown support.
- full-text search out-of-the-box.
- automatic [`a11y`](https://www.a11yproject.com/).
- filesystem-based organization.

Its integration with `Next.js` means that it's fully customizable,
making it ideal for your team to quickly generate a website
that is useful for both internal and external documentation.


# Who?

This walkthrough is meant for beginners of the framework
but also seasoned software developers 
that want to create internal and external documentation for their teams.

This will **not be an introduction to technical writing**,
it will solely focus on the `Nextra` framework.
We recommend visiting https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview
if you are interested in learning more about technical writing.

# How?

Are we ready to start? Let's go!

> [!TIP]
>
> Some of the information found in this document
> can also be found in the [`Nextra`'s offical docs](https://nextra.site/docs).
> We recommend going through their documentation 
> (it's not long) to better have a feeling over the framework.

When using `Nextra`, 
you first have to make a choice:
- you either use a *default theme*.
- you customize your own.

The vast majority of people will go for the former.
However, if you are looking to have a more customized look,
you may have to create your own theme.
[It's easier to start with a custom theme than using a default one and change it afterwards](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/issues/2926).

In our case, 
we'll start with the default theme and change it if needed.


## 0. Start a new project

Let's create our project.
We first need to install some dependencies.
We're going to use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
throughout the project to manage dependencies.

```sh
pnpm add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```

This will create a `package.json` file
and install the dependencies under `node_modules`.

Now, let's add some scripts to `package.json` 
to be able to run our application.
Add the following:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

Your `package.json` will look something like this.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^14.2.4",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "nextra": "^2.13.4",
    "nextra-theme-docs": "^2.13.4"
  }
}
```

Next, we need to add a `Nextra` config file.
Because we're starting a project from scratch,
it has no idea it's a `Next.js` project.
Create a file called `next.config.js` and add the following.

```js
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
})
 
module.exports = withNextra()
```

Lastly, we need to create
a corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project‚Äôs root directory.
It will be used to configure our `Nextra`'s site theme.
We'll just add the basic ones.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can check the full theme configurations
> [in their documentation](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

Now we're ready to bounce!
Because `Nextra` is a **file-based system framework**
(much like `Next.js`),
you will have to create all the documentation
under the `pages` folder.
Let's start create our first one under `pages/index.mdx`!

```mdx
# Welcome to our docs!
 
Hello, world!
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> [`mdx`](https://mdxjs.com/) files are markdown files
> that allow you to write `JSX` content.
> You can import components and embed them within your markdown files.

Let's see our handiwork.
Run `pnpm run dev` 
and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
You should see your page!

Congratulations!
You've just set up your documentation website!
Give yourself a pat on the back. üëè
